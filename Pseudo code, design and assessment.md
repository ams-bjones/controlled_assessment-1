Task 1
=====================

Pseudo code
---------------------

It will ask for what money you want to convert from.
It asks for the numbers 1 to 4.
This means if the user inputs 1 its pounds, if the user inputs 2 its euros and so on.
After that it then asks what currency you want to convert to.
Once again it asks the user to input 1 to 4 numbers.
It then takes the numbers (Rates) and multiplys then together.
It then prints out the answer.
The answer is the value of the two numbers you just multiplyed.
If you enter you want to convert from pounds, to pounds it just prints the number you entered.
