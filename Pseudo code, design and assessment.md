Task 1
=====================

a) The system should be able to have exchange rates changed regulary by the user
b) The user must input an amount, select a currency to convert from and to, and get the correct output
c) The amount must be put to two decimal places E.G Â£1.09

Pseudo code
---------------------

It will ask for what money you want to convert from.
It asks for the numbers 1 to 4.
This means if the user inputs 1 its pounds, if the user inputs 2 its euros and so on.
After that it then asks what currency you want to convert to.
Once again it asks the user to input 1 to 4 numbers.
It then takes the numbers (Rates) and multiplys then together.
It then prints out the answer.
The answer is the value of the two numbers you just multiplyed.
If you enter you want to convert from pounds, to pounds it just prints the number you entered.

This is my plan to make task one work.
